# Week 1 - Programming Fundamentals

# Object Oriented Programming

## Introduction

Next up on the programming fundamentals section is Object Oriented Programming.

We're going to revisit the Catalogue Service, except this time we're going to approach the design of the programme with an Object Oriented mindset. This means thinking about Books as objects with encapsulated data and behaviour.

## Technology

We'll continue to make use of the Javascript programming language within a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment and utilising a test framework called [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) to run our code.

## Instructions

The code structure is exactly the same as your [first steps in programming fundamentals](https://github.com/techreturners/javascript_fundamentals_001) so all the folders and files should already look familiar.

All the running and execution instructions are exactly the same as the previous fundamentals coding tasks.

**NOTE** After cloning this repository you need to `npm install` because we're in a new application code base.

Head on over to [tasks to get started](./docs/TASKS.md).
